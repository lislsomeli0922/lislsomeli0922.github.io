	<p>
		Karaoke is fun for the whole family and lets my sister release some energy to stop an attack from occuring later. We try to have a fun competition every 2 weeks especially since we got a new karaoke machine! None of us can sing well but I do have to admit that my sister has a pretty good voice.

		She has more fun singing Billie Eilish and the new popular songs on Tik Tok but I think she appreciates the classics. I don't mind losing best voice to her because I am pretty terrible if compared.
