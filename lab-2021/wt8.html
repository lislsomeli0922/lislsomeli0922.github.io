		500 Pieces Max
	</h2>
	<p>
		Puzzles are fun to do but its easier to limit the amount of pieces so that we aren't spending hours on a single puzzle, because once we start we want to finsh. My sister has a bunch of mini puzzles and some big ones that are more like projects while the mini ones are great for providing relief during anxiety attacks.

		How to Frame and Hang Up a Big Puzzle:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Mod Podge finished puzzle</li>
		<li>Make sure to cover front and back</li>
		<li>Wait for glue to dry</li>
		<li>Slowly slide puzzle onto the glass frame</li>
		<li>Add backing to frame</li>
		<li>Secure puzzle is in frame</li>
		<li>Hang up your project!</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		We only have a couple puzzles that my sister is very proud of hung up but I think she enjoys doing the mini ones moe since she can do them over and over again and it becomes a routine of comfort.
