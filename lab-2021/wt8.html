			Puzzles are fun to do but its easier to limit the amount of pieces so that we aren't spending hours on a single puzzle, because once we start we want to finsh. My sister has a bunch of mini puzzles and some big ones that are more like projects while the mini ones are great for providing relief during anxiety attacks.
