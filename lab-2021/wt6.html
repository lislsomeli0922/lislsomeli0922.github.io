		Since she has gotten older she has become more interested in doing creative makeup. She loves to do eyeshadow, she has a rainbow palette so she does new looks everytime. She is super creative and has a theme for each one. I always recommend her doing my makeup if she feels anxious because it makes her focus on something else.

		<li>Eyebrow Gel</li>
		<li>Contour</li>
		<li>Blush</li>
		<li>Eyeshadow</li>

	</ol>

		We've been able to gift her some makeup so that hse had ownership over something and it truly belonged to her, also I was a little tired of her messing up my palettes. Like I said, they're expensive!
