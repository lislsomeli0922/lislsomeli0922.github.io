			Reading a book is great for my sister to relax and learn some new words. Each month her teacher gives her 6 books to read so it's nice to read something new or catch up on her homework. Other nights she just likes to read a book she is familiar with and really enjoys.

			Some I have to read to her and that's pretty nice because she just sleeps instead of having to stay awake when she reads. I really like when she reads though because she learns new words each time and it makes me very proud of her big brain.
