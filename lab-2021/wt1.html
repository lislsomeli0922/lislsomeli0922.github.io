			If I am still full of energy I may be up for a drawing challenge. They're great to take my sisters mind of something particular that may have triggered her. We use specific catagories to change the topic and who ever has the best one in each catagory wins an exciting 25 CENTS!

	<div class="list">

			Some of our favorite catagories are:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Butterflies</li>
			<li>Disney Princess</li>
			<li>Exotic Animals</li>
			<li>Something in the Room</li>
			<li>Favorite Plush Toy</li>
		</ol>

			Now I may be doing this to calm my sister down but it is still a competition and I do not like to lose. I think she somewhat appreciates my competitiveness (hopefully) because it really makes her focus on making a strong drawing.
