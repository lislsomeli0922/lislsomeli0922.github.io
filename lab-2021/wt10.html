		<p>It should be no surprise that my sister loves filming Tik Toks. I mean who doesn't? It has definitely become more popular and common during the pandemic and it is really entertaining. It's really fun to do the challenges and transitions to for our amazing makeup skills.</p>

		<p>Although it use to be a bit embarassing to use the app a couple years ago I think it has really evolved and highlights the significance of social media to people's lives. My sister loves to be on the app and whenever she feels sad or in a grumpy mood it makes her day to have someone in the family participate in her tik tok video ideas.</p>
