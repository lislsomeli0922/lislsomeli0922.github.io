		Fidgets are amazing for whenever my sister feels her anxiety coming on. She uses them to stop her anxiety from progressingand they're actually pretty fun for everyone to use. My favorite is the rubix cube or the pop toy.

		She has about 40 little fidgets and stores them in a box with pull out shelves. The box is small enough to travel with and makes it great for whenever we feel like taking a trip.
