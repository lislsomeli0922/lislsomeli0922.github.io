		A Little Creepy But Hilarious
	</h2>
	<p>
		In an improv move while my sister felt an anxiety attack coming on and started to freak out a bit I started talking to her in my Dobby voice and she just started laughing! She makes me pull out the impression sometimes during random times and it's one of those tricks that works in the middle of the night because it doesn't require that much energy or effort.

		I just want it to be known that it is not a good impression and I think the fact that it is so bad is what. akes her laugh. We have a lot of fun creating scenarios in the voices and acting out our favorite scenes.
