    <!-- In the <p></p> tags, write a paragraph about your partner's online habits. -->
    <p>
      Hannah spent most of her time using social, entertainment, and travel apps on January 20th. I questioned why one <br> of her top subjects was travel and she explained how she had just moved back to New York and was frequently <br> using maps to get around. Entertainment was a big one for her especially on apps like Tik Tok, Netflix, and Spotify <br> since she loves to listen to music while doing homework. Hannah also used apps like Instagram and Snap to connect <br> with her friends and family since her move from Long Island to the city.
