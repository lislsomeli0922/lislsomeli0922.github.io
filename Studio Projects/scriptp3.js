alert("For this project I wanted to explore the relationship between the internet and cats! Why are cats such a meme? Is it their facial expressions or how their bodies look that make them so funny?? Through this website you are able to create your own meme and see if it works for you or not, your sense of humor dictates how the cat is seen and how a meme is finalized.
