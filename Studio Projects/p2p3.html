			This design is meant to represent the overwheming feeling the text stresses of <br> growing and how nothing will ever be as beautiful as the original "garden". I <br> chose this design because it was the most relevant to the text and for part 3 I <br> have been exploring color and typeface. I am still having difficulty finding the <br> right coding but I do have the basis of it done. I am also trying to see if the <br> typeface can change as well from something like Times New Roman to a <br> decorative typeface.
