		<h1>The <span>Disturbances</span> of the <span>Garden</span></h1>
		<h2>By <span>Jamaica</span> Kincaid</h2>
		<p>
		My <span>obsession</span> with the <span>garden</span> and the events that take place in it began before I was <span>familiar</span> with that entity called <span>consciousness</span>. My <span>mother</span> taught me to read when I was <span>very young</span>, and she did this without telling me that there was something called the <span>alphabet</span>. I became familiar with <span>words</span> as if they were all wholly themselves, each one a world by itself, <span>intact and self-contained</span>, and able to be joined to other words if they wished to or if <span>someone like me</span> wanted them to. The <span>book</span> she taught me to read from was a <span>biography of Louis Pasteur</span>, the person she told me was <span>responsible</span> for her boiling the milk I drank <span>daily</span>, making sure that it would not <span>infect me</span> with something called <span>tuberculosis</span>. I never got tuberculosis, but I did get <span>typhoid fever</span>, <span>whooping cough</span>, <span>measles</span>, and persistent cases of hookworm and long worms. I was a <span>“sickly child.”</span> Much of the <span>love</span> I remember receiving from <span>my mother</span> came during the times <span>I was sick.</span> I have such a <span>lovely memory</span> of her <span>hovering</span> over me with cups of <span>barley water</span> (that was for the <span>measles</span>) and giving me <span>cups of tea</span> made from <span>herbs</span> (bush) that she had gone out and gathered and steeped slowly (that was for the <span>whooping cough</span>). For the <span>typhoid fever</span>, she took me to <span>the hospital</span>, the <span>children’s ward</span>, but she visited me <span>twice a day</span> and brought me <span>fresh juice</span> that she had squeezed or grated from <span>fruits</span> or <span>vegetables</span>, because she was certain that the <span>hospital</span> would not provide me with <span>proper nourishment</span>. And so there I was, <span>a sickly child</span> who could <span>read</span> but had <span>no sense</span> of <span>consciousness</span>, had <span>no idea</span> of how to <span>understand</span> and so make <span>sense of the world</span> into which she was <span>born</span>, a <span>world</span> that was always <span>full</span> of a <span>yellow sun</span>, <span>green trees</span>, a <span>blue sea</span>, and <span>black people</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
		My <span>mother</span> was a <span>gardener</span>, and in her <span>garden</span> it was as if <span>Vertumnus and Pomona</span> had become one: she would find something <span>growing</span> in the wilds of her <span>native island</span> (Dominica) or the <span>island</span> on which she lived and gave <span>birth</span> to me (Antigua), and if it <span>pleased her</span>, or if it was in <span>fruit</span> and the <span>taste of the fruit</span> delighted her, she took a <span>cutting</span> of it (really she just broke off a shoot with her <span>bare hands</span>) or the <span>seed</span> (separating it from its <span>pulpy</span> substance and <span>collecting</span> it in her <span>beautiful pink mouth</span>) and brought it into her own <span>garden</span> and tended to it in a <span>careless</span>, everyday way, as if it were in the <span>wild forest</span>, or in the <span>garden</span> of a <span>regal palace</span>. <span>The woods</span>: <span>The garden</span>. For her, the wild and the cultivated were <span>equal</span> and yet <span>separate</span>, <span>together</span> and <span>apart</span>. This wasn’t as <span>clear</span> to me then as I am stating it here. I had only just <span>learned</span> to read and the <span>world outside a book</span> I did not yet know how to <span>reconcile</span>.
		</p>
		<p>
		The only <span>book</span> <span>available</span> to me, a book I was <span>allowed</span> to read all by <span>myself</span> without anyone paying <span>attention</span> to me, was the <span>King James Version of the Bible</span>. There’s no <span>need</span> for me to go into the <span>troubles</span> with the <span>King James Version of the Bible</span> here, but when I encountered the <span>first book</span>, the <span>Book of Genesis</span>, I immediately <span>understood</span> it to be a <span>book for children</span>. A person, I came to understand much later, exists in the <span>kingdom of children</span> no matter how <span>old</span> the person is; even <span>Methuselah</span>, I came to see, was <span>a child</span>. But never mind that, it was the <span>creation story</span> that was so <span>compelling</span> to me, especially the <span>constant refrain</span> <span>“And God saw that it was good.”</span> The <span>God</span> in the <span>Book of Genesis</span> made things, and at the end of each day he saw that they were good. But, I wondered, for something to be <span>good</span> would there not have to be something that was <span>not good</span>, or <span>not as good?</span> That was a <span>problem</span>, though I didn’t <span>bother myself</span> with it at the <span>time</span>, mainly because I didn’t know how to, and also because the story had an <span>inexorableness</span> to it: <span>rolling on</span> from one thing to another <span>without a pause</span> until, by the end of <span>six days</span>, there were <span>a man and a woman made in God’s image</span>, there were <span>fish in the sea</span> and <span>animals creeping on land</span> and <span>birds flying in the air</span> and <span>plants growing</span>, and <span>God</span> found it <span>all good</span>, because <span>here we are</span>.
		</p>
	<p>
	It was in the <span>week</span> after this <span>creation</span>, on the <span>eighth day</span>, that the <span>trouble</span> began: <span>loneliness</span> set in. And so <span>God made a garden</span>, dividing it into <span>four quarters</span> by running <span>water</span> through it (the classic <span>quadrilinear</span> style that is still a standard in <span>garden design</span>) and placing <span>borders</span>, the <span>borders</span> being the <span>eternal good</span> and <span>evil</span>: the <span>Tree of Life</span> and the <span>Tree of Knowledge</span>. One tree was to be <span>partaken of</span>, the other <span>forbidden</span>. I have since come to see that in the <span>garden</span> itself, throughout <span>human association</span> with it, the <span>Edenic plan</span> works in the same way: the <span>Tree of Life</span> is <span>agriculture</span> and the <span>Tree of Knowledge</span> is <span>horticulture</span>. We cultivate food, and when there is a <span>surplus</span> of it, producing <span>wealth</span>, we cultivate the spaces of <span>contemplation</span>, a <span>garden</span> of <span>plants</span> not necessary for <span>physical survival</span>. The <span>awareness</span> of that fact is what gives the garden its <span>special</span>, <span>powerful</span> place in our lives and our <span>imaginations</span>. The Tree of Knowledge holds <span>unknown</span>, and therefore <span>dangerous</span> possibilities; the Tree of Life is <span>eternally necessary</span>, and the Tree of Knowledge is deeply and divinely <span>dependent</span> on it. This is not a new thought for me. I could see it in my mother’s <span>relationship</span> to the things she grew, the kind of <span>godlike domination</span> she would display <span>over</span> them. She, I remember, didn’t make such fine distinctions, she only moved the plants around when they <span>pleased</span> her and <span>destroyed</span> them when they <span>fell</span> out of <span>favor</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
	It is no <span>surprise</span> to me that my <span>affection</span> for the <span>garden</span>, including its most <span>disturbing</span> attributes, its most <span>violent</span> implications and associations, is <span>intertwined</span> with my <span>mother</span>. As a <span>child</span>, I did not know <span>myself</span> or the world I <span>inhabited</span> without her. She is the person who <span>gave me</span> and <span>taught me</span> <span>the Word</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
	But where is the <span>garden</span> and where am <span>I in it?</span> This <span>memory</span> of <span>growing</span> things, anything, outside not inside, <span>remained</span> in my <span>memory</span>—or whatever we call that <span>haunting</span>, <span>invisible</span> wisp that is <span>steadily</span> part of our being—and <span>wherever</span> I lived in my <span>young years</span>, in New York City in <span>particular</span>, I <span>planted</span>: marigolds, portulaca, herbs for <span>cooking</span>, petunias, and other things that were <span>familiar</span> to me, all <span>reminding</span> me of my <span>mother</span>, the place I came <span>from</span>. Those first <span>plants</span> were in <span>pots</span> and <span>lived</span> on the <span>roof</span> of a diner that served only breakfast and lunch, in a <span>dilapidated</span> building at 284 Hudson Street, whose <span>ownership</span> was uncertain, which is the <span>fate</span> of us all. <span>Ownership</span> of ourselves and of the <span>ground</span> on which we <span>walk</span>, ownership of the other beings with whom we share this and see that it is <span>good</span>, and <span>ownership</span> of the vegetable kingdom are all <span>uncertain</span>, too. Nevertheless, in the <span>garden</span>, we perform the act of <span>possessing</span>. To name is to possess; possessing is the <span>original violation</span> bequeathed to Adam and his <span>equal</span> companion in <span>creation</span>, Eve, by their <span>creator</span>. It is their <span>transgression</span> in disregarding his <span>command</span> that leads him not only to cast them into the <span>wilderness</span>, the <span>unknown</span>, but also to cast out the other <span>possession</span> that he <span>designed</span> with great <span>clarity</span> and <span>determination</span> and purpose: the <span>garden!</span> For me, the <span>story</span> of the <span>garden</span> in <span>Genesis</span> is a way of understanding my <span>garden obsession</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
	The <span>appearance</span> of the <span>garden</span> in our <span>everyday</span> life is so <span>accepted</span> that we <span>embrace</span> its presence as <span>therapeutic</span>. Some people say that <span>weeding</span> is a form of <span>comfort</span> and of <span>settling</span> into <span>misery</span> or <span>happiness</span>. The <span>garden</span> makes managing an excess of <span>feelings</span>—<span>good</span> feelings, <span>bad</span> feelings—<span>rewarding</span> in some way that I can <span>never</span> quite <span>understand</span>. The <span>garden</span> is a heap of <span>disturbance</span>, and it may be that my <span>particular</span> history, the history I share with <span>millions</span> of people, begins with our ancestors’ <span>violent removal</span> from an <span>Eden</span>. The regions of <span>Africa</span>< from which they came would have been Eden-like, and the <span>horror</span> that met them in that “New World” could certainly be seen as the <span>Fall</span>. Your <span>home</span>, the place you are from, is always <span>Eden</span>, the place where even <span>imperfections</span> were <span>perfect</span>, and everything that happened after that beginning <span>interrupted</span> your <span>Paradise</span>.
	On August 3, 1492—the day that <span>Christopher Columbus</span> set sail from Spain, later having a <span>fatal</span> encounter with the <span>indigenous</span> people he met in the “West Indies”—the world of the <span>garden</span> changed. That <span>endeavor</span>, to me, anyway, is the way the <span>world</span> we now live in began; it not only affected the <span>domestic</span> life of <span>Europeans</span> (where did the people in a <span>Rembrandt painting</span> get all that stuff they are piling on?) but <span>suddenly</span> they were well-off enough to be <span>interested</span> in more than <span>sustenance</span>, or the <span>Tree of Life</span> (agriculture); they could now be interested in <span>cultivating</span> the fruits of the <span>Tree of Knowledge</span> (horticulture).
	</p>
	<p>
	Suddenly, the <span>conquerors</span> could do more than <span>feed</span> themselves; they could also see and <span>desire</span> things that were of <span>no use</span> apart from the <span>pleasure</span> that they produced. When Cortés saw <span>Montezuma’s garden</span>, a garden that incorporated a <span>lake</span> on which the <span>capital</span> of Mexico now sits, he didn’t mention the <span>profusion</span> of <span>exotic</span> flowers that we now <span>grow</span> with <span>ease</span> in our own <span>gardens</span> (dahlias, zinnias, marigolds).
	</p>
	<p>
	The <span>garden</span> figures prominently in the <span>era</span> of <span>conquest</span>, starting with Captain Cook’s <span>voyage</span> to regions that we now know as <span>Australia</span>, New Zealand, New Guinea, and Tahiti, its aim, <span>ostensibly</span>, to observe the <span>rare</span> event of the <span>transit</span> of Venus. On this trip, in 1768, the first of Cook’s three voyages around the world, he <span>brought</span> with him the <span>botanist</span> Joseph Banks and also Daniel Charles Solander, a <span>student</span> of Carolus Linnaeus. The two took <span>careful notes</span> on <span>everything</span> they saw. Banks <span>decided</span> that the <span>breadfruit</span> of the Pacific isles would make a good <span>food</span> for <span>slaves</span> on British-owned islands in the West Indies; the <span>slaveholders</span> were <span>concerned</span> with the amount of time it took the <span>enslaved people</span> to <span>grow food</span> to <span>sustain</span> themselves, and <span>breadfruit</span> grew with little <span>cultivation</span>. And so the Pacific Islands came to the West Indies. Banks also introduced the <span>cultivation</span> of <span>tea</span> (Camellia sinensis) to India.
	</p>
	<p>
	Then there is <span>Lewis</span> and <span>Clark’s</span> expedition from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Northwest. On that <span>adventure</span>, which was <span>authorized</span> by President Thomas Jefferson and was <span>inspired</span> by Cook’s <span>scientific</span> and <span>commercial</span> interests, the <span>explorers</span> listed <span>numerous</span> plant species that were <span>unknown</span> to John Bartram, <span>botanist</span> to King George III, who <span>ruled</span> the United States when it was <span>still</span> a colony. Bartram’s son, William, a fellow-botanist, later <span>wrote</span> a <span>book</span> about his own <span>explorations</span>, which is said to have <span>influenced</span> Wordsworth, Coleridge, and other <span>English</span> <span>Romantic</span> <span>poets</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
	There now, <span>look</span> at that: I am meaning to <span>show</span> how I came to <span>seek</span> the <span>garden</span> in corners of the world <span>far away</span> from where I make one, and I have got <span>lost</span> in <span>thickets</span> of <span>words</span>. It was after I started to put <span>seeds</span> in the <span>ground</span> and <span>noticed</span> that sometimes <span>nothing</span> happened that I <span>reached</span> for a <span>book</span>. The first ones I read were about how to make a <span>perennial</span> <span>border</span> or how to get the <span>best</span> out of annuals—the kind of books for people who want to <span>increase</span> the <span>value</span> of their home—but these books were so <span>boring</span>. I found an <span>old</span> magazine meant to help <span>white ladies</span> manage their <span>domestic</span> lives in the nineteen-fifties much more <span>interesting</span> (that kind of <span>magazine</span>, along with a <span>copy</span> of “Mrs. Beeton’s Book of Household Management,” is <span>worthy</span> of a day spent in <span>bed</span> while the <span>sun</span> is shining its <span>brightest</span> outside). But where did <span>plants</span>, annual and perennial, <span>pristinely</span> set out in something called a <span>border</span>, and arranged sometimes according to <span>color</span> and sometimes according to <span>height</span>, come from? Those <span>books</span> had no answer for me. So one book led to <span>another</span>, and before long I had <span>acquired</span> (and read) so many books that it put a <span>strain</span> on my family’s <span>budget</span>. <span>Resentment</span>, a not <span>unfamiliar</span> feeling relating to the garden, <span>set in</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
	I began to <span>refer</span> to <span>plants</span> by their <span>Latin names</span>, and this so <span>irritated</span> my editor at this magazine (Veronica Geng) that she made me <span>promise</span> that I would never learn the <span>Latin name</span> of another plant. I <span>loved</span> her very much, and so I <span>promised</span> that I would <span>never</span> do such a thing, but I did <span>continue</span> to <span>learn</span> the <span>Latin names</span> of plants and <span>never</span> told her. <span>Betrayal</span>, another feature of any <span>garden</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
	How did <span>plants</span> get their <span>names</span>? I looked to <span>Linnaeus</span>, who, it <span>turned</span> out, liked to <span>name plants</span> after people whose <span>character</span> they <span>resembled</span>. <span>Mischievous</span>, yes, but not too different from the <span>doctrine</span> of <span>signatures</span>, which attempted to <span>cure diseases</span> by using plants that resembled the <span>diseased</span> part of the <span>body</span>. I was <span>thinking</span> about this one day, <span>stooped</span> over and admiring a <span>colony</span> of Jeffersonia <span>diphylla</span>, whose common name is <span>twinleaf</span>. Jeffersonia diphylla is a short woodland <span>herbaceous ephemeral</span> whose leaf is <span>perforated</span> at the base so that it often looks like a <span>luna moth</span>, but the two leaflets are not <span>identical</span> at the margins, and each leaf is <span>not</span> evenly divided: the margins <span>undulate</span>, and one leaflet is a little bigger than the other. But isn’t Thomas Jefferson, the <span>gardener</span>, the <span>liberty lover</span> and <span>slaveowner</span>, often described as divided, and isn’t it <span>appropriate</span> that a plant such as the twinleaf is named for him? The name was <span>bestowed</span> by one of his <span>contemporaries</span>, Benjamin Smith Barton, who perhaps guessed at his true character. It was through this plant that I became <span>interested</span> in Thomas Jefferson. I have read much of what he <span>wrote</span> and have firm <span>opinions</span> about him, including that his book “Notes on the State of Virginia” is a <span>creation</span> story.
	</p>
	<p>
	It was only a matter of <span>time</span> before I <span>stumbled</span> on the plant <span>hunters</span>, although this <span>inevitability</span> was not <span>clear</span> to me at all. Look at me: my <span>historical</span> <span>reality</span>, my <span>ancestral</span> memory, which is so deeply <span>embedded</span> that I think the <span>whole</span> world <span>understands</span> me before I even <span>open</span> my <span>mouth</span>. A big <span>mistake</span>, but a mistake not big <span>enough</span> for me to have <span>learned</span> anything from it. The plant <span>hunters</span> are the <span>descendants</span> of people and ideas that used to <span>hunt</span> people <span>like me</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
	The <span>first</span> one I met, in a <span>book</span>, of course, was <span>Frank Smythe</span>. No one had ever <span>made</span> me think that finding a new <span>primrose</span>—or a new flower of any kind—was as <span>special</span> as finding a <span>new island</span> in the Caribbean Sea when I thought I was going to <span>China</span> to <span>meet</span> the Great Khan. A new primrose is more <span>special</span> than meeting <span>any conqueror</span>. But Smythe <span>gave me more</span> than that. I <span>noticed</span>, when <span>reading</span> his <span>accounts</span>, that he was always <span>going off</span> on <span>little</span> side <span>journeys</span> to <span>climb</span> some snow-covered <span>protuberance</span> not so <span>far away</span>, and then days later <span>returning</span> with a story of <span>failure</span> or <span>success</span> at <span>reaching</span> or <span>not reaching</span> the <span>peak</span>, and that by the way he had found some <span>beauty</span> of the <span>vegetable</span> kingdom on the banks of a <span>hidden</span> stream which would be new to every <span>benighted</span> soul in England. But his other <span>gift</span> to me was the <span>pleasure</span> to be had in going to see a <span>plant</span> that I might <span>love or not</span>, <span>growing</span> somewhere far away. It was in his <span>writing</span> that I found the <span>distance</span> between the <span>garden</span> I was looking at and the garden in the <span>wilderness</span>, the garden <span>cast</span> out of its <span>Eden</span> which created a <span>longing</span> in me, the <span>notion</span> of “to go and to see.” <span>Go see!</span>
	</p>
	<p>
	I <span>end</span> where I <span>began</span>: <span>reading—learning</span> to read and reading <span>books</span>, the <span>words</span> a <span>form of food</span>, a <span>form of life?</span>, and then <span>knowledge</span>. But also my <span>mother</span>. I don’t know exactly how <span>old</span> I was when she <span>taught</span> me to <span>read</span>, but I can say for certain that by the <span>time</span> I was <span>three</span> and a half I could read <span>properly</span>. This reading of mine so <span>interfered</span> with her own time to read that she enrolled me in <span>school</span>; but you could be enrolled in school only if you were <span>five</span> years old, and so she told me to <span>remember</span> to say, if asked, that I was <span>five</span>. My first <span>performance</span> as a writer of <span>fiction</span>? No, not that at all. Perhaps this: the first time I was asked <span>who I was</span>. And who am I<span>?</span> In an <span>ideal</span> world, a world in which the <span>Tree of Life</span> and the <span>Tree of Knowledge</span> stand before me, before all of us, we ask, <span>Who am I?</span> Among the many of <span>us</span> not given a chance to answer is the <span>woman</span> in the <span>library</span> in St. John’s, Antigua, <span>two large rooms</span> above the Treasury Department, a building that was steps away from the customs office and the <span>wharf</span> where things coming and going <span>lay</span>. On that <span>wharf</span> worked a <span>stevedore</span> who loaded onto ships bags of <span>raw sugar</span> en route to England, to be refined into white sugar, which was so <span>expensive</span> that we, in my family, had it only on Sundays, as a <span>special</span> treat. I did not know of the <span>stevedore</span>, the <span>lover</span> of this woman who would not <span>allow</span> her <span>children</span> to have much white <span>sugar</span> because, somewhere in the <span>world</span> of Dr. Pasteur and his <span>cohort</span>, they had come to all sorts of <span>conclusions</span> about <span>diseases</span> and their <span>relationships</span> to food (beriberi was a disease my mother succeeded in saving me from suffering). Her <span>name</span> was <span>Annie Victoria Richardson Drew</span>, and she was <span>born</span> in a <span>village</span> in Dominica, British West Indies.
