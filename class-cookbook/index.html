	<h1>Spicy Cold Noodles</h1>

	<p> Chewy Salad for Sticky Days.</p>

	<div class="container">
		<div class="ingredients">
			<ul>thick rice noodles</ul>
			<ul>light soy</ul>
			<ul>laoganma</ul>
			<ul>sesame oil</ul>
			<ul>spring onion</ul>
			<ul>cucumber</ul>
			<ul>coriander</ul>
			<ul id="optional">sesame seeds (optional)</ul>
		</div>

		<div class="steps">
			<ol id="step1">bring a pan of water to the boil, and add the noodles. I like to use the thick rice noodles as they're satisfyingly chewy, but this dish works equally well with the thinner chinese wheat noodles (though if you're having this as a packed lunch, they can get a bit sticky during a day in the fridge). In an ideal world this is made with hand-pulled noodles (chewy and wheaty), but that's a lot of effort. Don't overcook them: you want them to still have some bounce. After draining them, rinse well with cold water, until they're cool.</ol>
			<ol>slice the cucumber lengthways into very thin strips with a sharp knife. finely chop the coriander and spring onions, and mix with the noodles. dress with sesame oil, laoganma and light soy, and mix well. sprinkle with sesame seeds.</ol>
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>Makes a great packed lunch with a tea egg. Also good to add are steamed greens, aburaage, bean sprouts, or toasted peanuts.</p>

	<h3>Spicy Hot Noodles:</h3>
	<p>don't cool the noodles (duh), then add fried enokis steamed greens and a boiled egg in place of the cucumber. also great with some tofu puffs.</p>
